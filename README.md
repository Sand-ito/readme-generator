# readme-generator
Hi! My name is Josh. Welcome to my README Generator!

[link to demo!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18pTuZDfkc29bRs--6nIWs6kh-hJDgZC_/view)

[here is a link to the repo](https://github.com/Sand-ito/readme-generator)

To operate it you need to cd into the develop directory and then run `node index.js`. You should then be prompted to fill out what you need for your readme. After that look in your develop directory and it should write your new readme! If you need visual steps use the link to the demo to see how I operate it.

Thank you so much for your time looking through my code. I appreciate all the feedback you can give me.

Have a nice day!

-Josh
